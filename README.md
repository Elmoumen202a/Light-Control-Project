# 🌟 Light Control Project 🚥

## Overview 📋

Welcome to the Light Control Project! This Python script allows you to simulate the control of a light using keyboard inputs. The script leverages the `keyboard` library to detect key presses and toggles the light on and off when the 'Ctrl' key is pressed. You can exit the program gracefully by pressing the 'q' key.

## Usage 🚀

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Elmoumen202a/Light-Control-Project.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd light-control-project
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the tests to ensure everything is working correctly:**

   ```bash
   pytest tests.py
   ```

5. **Run the main script to control the light:**

   ```bash
   python light_control.py
   ```

   Follow the on-screen instructions to control the light using the 'Ctrl' key. Press 'q' to gracefully exit the program.

## Requirements 🛠️

The project relies on the following Python libraries:

- `keyboard`
- `pytest` (for testing)

These dependencies are listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

## Testing 🧪
